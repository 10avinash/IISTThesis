               Guidelines for iist.cls LaTeX Template 
              ----------------------------------------

The LaTeX template 'iist.cls' is developed for creating reports/theses
for undergraduate, graduate, and PhD students with minimal effort in
scripting.

1. How to Start?

The template is defined in LaTeX class file 'iist.cls' included in the
folder. The main LaTeX source file that needs to be built/compiled is
'doct.tex'. At the first line of 'doct.tex', the document class is
mentioned as the custom style iist. Options to the document class vary
according to your degree and the type of report that you are
writing. The variations are as follows:

  B.Tech Internship: \documentclass[btech,internship,twoside]{iist} 
  B.Tech Project: \documentclass[btech,project,twoside]{iist}    
  M.Tech Thesis: \documentclass[mtech,thesis,twoside]{iist}     
  M.S Thesis: \documentclass[ms,thesis,twoside]{iist}        
  PhD Thesis: \documentclass[phd,thesis,twoside]{iist}       
  PhD Synopsis: \documentclass[phd,synopsis,twoside]{iist}     

Notes:

 (a) If you want to create single sided report, remove the option
     'twoside' from the above-mentioned line.

 (b) The template uses Times as the default font. Instead, if you want
     to use default LaTeX font, i.e., Computer Modern, uncomment the
     line '\usepackage{times}' in 'doct.tex'.


2. Specifying Credentials of the Report/Thesis

Provisions for specifying the report/thesis credentials are made
simple that you need to mention them only once. Credentials will be
taken to the initial pages of the document, such as Title Page,
Certificate, Declaration, and Acknowledgements, wherever required.
The commands for providing the report credentials are as follows:

  Document Title: \title{}
  Author: \author{}
  Author ID: \studentid{}
  Project/Thesis Advisor: \advisor{}
  Specialization: \specialization{}
  Department: \department{}
  Date: \date{}  


3. Creating Initial Pages of the Report/Thesis

The initial pages of report/thesis include Title Page, Certificate,
Declaration, Dedication, and Acknowledgements. The content of these
pages will be filled automatically with the credentials provided as
described in Section 2. If you want to edit the contents in any of the
initial pages (For example, editing the designation of Head of the
Department or Supervisor in certificate page, content for dedication
and acknowledgement), you need to edit the appropriate TeX source. The
source files corresponding to the initial pages are as follows:

  Certificate: 'certificate.tex'
  Declaration: 'declaration.tex'
  Dedication: 'dedication.tex'
  Acknowledgements: 'acknowledgements.tex'
  Abstract: 'abstract.tex'
  Nomenclature: 'nomenclature.tex'
	
The pages Table of Contents, List of Figures, List of Tables, and List
of Algorithms are automatically generated from the contents of the
report/thesis. Since PhD synopsis does not require some of the initial
pages, you can comment the lines \makecertificate, \makedeclaration,
\makeacknowledgements, \makelistoffigures, \makelistoftables, and
\makelistofalgorithms in 'doct.tex'.


4. Addition of Chapters

In order to include chapters, it is better to organize each chapter
into different TeX files. For example 'chapter1.tex', 'chapter2.tex',
'chapter3.tex' and so on. You can include each chapter in the report
using the \makechapter command. For example, 'chapter1.tex' can be
included using the command

			\makechapter{chapter1}
				
Appendices can are also included as chapters, whose TeX source is
specified in 'appendix.tex'.


5. Addition of Bibliography

Bibliographies can be added using BibTeX tool with the appropriate
citation style. A separate file named doct.bib is provided to specify
the BibTeX entries of the citations present in the report/thesis. In
'doct.tex', bibliographies can be included in using the following
commands

			\bibliographystyle{IEEEtran}
			\bibliography{doct}
				
In the template, the bibliography style of IEEE is used. However, you
can replace the style IEEEtran with other styles such as unsrt, plain,
and apa.


6. Building the LaTeX Source

If you have installed the tool latexmk, just build 'doct.tex' using
latexmk. Otherwise, you need to follow the default LaTeX building
process using the following steps:

1. Build doct.tex using pdflatex
2. Build doct.bib using bibtex
3. Build doct.tex using pdflatex
4. Build doct.tex using pdflatex
